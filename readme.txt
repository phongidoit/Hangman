I made this project just for fun, and at the moment, I'm trying to get used to GitHub so this will be the first thing on my GitHub account. 
In a few more year, it will look silly but hey, I'm still learning. 

About: It is just a hangman game, where it given you word with some character is hidden, your word is to guess the hidden word. You have 5 tries per each word, reduced by one for every incorrect try, number of tries is displayed by health line: | . When required, type y(for yes) and n (for no). 

The text_base.txt is where all the words stored and that was added manually so it don't have much word right now. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
